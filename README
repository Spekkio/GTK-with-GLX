Quits with error

(main:5479): Gdk-WARNING **: /build/buildd/gtk+2.0-2.24.10/gdk/x11/gdkdrawable-x11.c:952 drawable is not a pixmap or window
The program 'main' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'GLXBadDrawable'.
  (Details: serial 508 error_code 149 request_code 136 minor_code 11)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
